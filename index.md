In August 2025, Google [announced](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification) that starting next year,
it will no longer be possible to develop apps for the Android platform
without first registering centrally with Google.
This registration will involve:

- Paying a fee to Google
{:.li-list .li-money}
- Agreeing to Google's Terms and Conditions
{:.li-list .li-terms}
- Providing government identification
{:.li-list .li-id}
- Uploading evidence of the developer's private signing key
{:.li-list .li-signing}
- Listing all current and future application identifiers
{:.li-list .li-appids}

## What this means for your rights

➤ You, **the consumer**, purchased your Android device believing in Google’s promise that it was an open computing platform and that you could run whatever software you choose on it. Instead, starting next year, they will be non-consensually pushing an update to your operating system that irrevocably blocks this right and leaves you at the mercy of their judgement over what software you are permitted to trust.

➤ You, **the creator**, can no longer develop an app and share it directly with your friends, family, and community without first seeking Google’s approval. The promise of Android — and a marketing advantage it has used to distinguish itself against the iPhone — has always been that it is “open”. But Google clearly feels that they have enough of a lock on the Android ecosystem, along with sufficient regulatory capture, that they can now jettison this principle with prejudice and impunity.

➤ You, **the state**, are ceding the rights of your citizens and your own digital sovereignty to a company with a track record of complying with the extrajudicial demands of authoritarian regimes to remove perfectly legal apps that they happen to dislike. The software that is critical to the running of your businesses and governments will be at the mercy of the opaque whims of a distant and unaccountable corporation.

## How you can help

### Consumers: Contact national regulators

Regulators worldwide are genuinely concerned about monopolies and the centralization of power in the tech sector, and want to hear directly from individuals who are affected and concerned. When contacting regulators directly, you should be _polite_ and _specific_ about the harm you believe these policies will cause, both to consumers and to competition.

Complaints are especially impactful when they are authored by a citizen of that country or region, and when the language of the email is written in one of the official languages of the region's governing body. Request a _written acknowledgement_ of the complaint, and consider forwarding any responses you receive to [victory@keepandroidopen.org](mailto:victory@keepandroidopen.org) so that we might highlight and reference them.

### Developers: Resist and refuse

If you are an app developer, _**do not sign up**_ for the early access program, perform identity verification, or accept an invitation to the Android Developer Console. Respond (politely) to any invitation with a list of your concerns and objections.

—— _It is only through developer acquiescence that their takeover plan can possibly succeed._ ——

Discourage fellow app developers and organizations from signing up to the program. Use community forums, social media, and blog posts to spread the message. Include the [FreeDroidWarn library](https://github.com/woheller69/FreeDroidWarn) in your code to inform your app users.

If you are a Google employee or contractor of good conscience and have additional insight about the program, including planned technical implementation details or additional rationales for the program, please reach out to [tips@keepandroidopen.org](mailto:tips@keepandroidopen.org) from a _non-work_ machine and a _non-gmail_ account. Your information will be kept in strict confidence.

### Everyone: Make your voice heard

- [Install F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) on your Android device(s). The more people that use alternative app marketplaces, the harder it will be to shut them out.
- Add your organization's signature to the draft [Open Letter to Google Regarding Mandatory Developer Registration for Third-Party App Distribution](https://docs.fediverse.foundation/pad/#/2/pad/view/OkfvdusnqafC8Wv+WUVpXB8RQk6XUFxmFHIa6CiBxQI/) by emailing [signatories@keepandroidopen.org](mailto:signatories@keepandroidopen.org?subject=Signature%20for%20keepandroidopen.org) with your name, title, and affiliation.
- Provide feedback directly to Google using their [Android developer verification requirements survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN3UQeNspQsZCO2ITkdzMxv81rJDEGGjO-UIDDY28Rz_GEVA/viewform?pli=1).
- Make your voice heard on social media and with blog posts, and link to <https://keepandroidopen.org>
- Combat astroturfing: when you encounter suspect posts on community forums and social media in support of the policy (“Well, actually…”), challenge them and do not be shy.
- Help this project out by [editing this page](https://github.com/keepandroidopen/keepandroidopen.github.io/blob/main/index.md) with more useful information.
- [Sign this change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/stop-google-from-limiting-apk-file-usage?recruiter=1370041382&recruited_by_id=fddec6e0-0e30-11f0-a55d-cd0eb0fd0ac4)
